#### Intro
I am currently a PhD student majoring in CSE at the Ohio State University. My main research area is around NLP and Computational Linguistic. I am interested in Discourse and Text Simplification. Previously, I also did some research on NLP in social media.
<br>
I am fortunate to work with my advisor Professor [Wei Xu]("https://cocoxu.github.io/"). I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [University of Texas at Austin]("http://utexas.edu") and worked closely with Professor [Jessy Li]("https://jjessyli.github.io/").

<!-- #### Currently
At Arthena I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [arthena.com](https://arthena.com)).
